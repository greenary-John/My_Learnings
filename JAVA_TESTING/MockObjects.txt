Mocks are way to simulate some dependencies in testing java classes. The Unreal Objects are classified as below:

1. Dummies - All methods dummied out. They just return default values for java types/objects. False for boolean,
   0 for numbers, null for object references. Any good ide will generate if you implement methods of an interface 
   or try to generate methods.
2. Stubs - Some methods return known values. They are coded to return non default known values and can be used in
   testing the code.
3. Mocks - They are more smarter than dummy code and Stubs. They can do something useful and can have expectations.
   They are objects that can stand in for another.
4. Fakes - Fakes are Functional but not the live versions. For example, a local in memory copy of a database.They
   are significantly faster. Can help avoiding putting test data into live database.

Mockito.org provides an open source Framework for unit testing by means of Mocks.
Jmockit is another framework for achieving the same and is packed with more features than Mockit.
