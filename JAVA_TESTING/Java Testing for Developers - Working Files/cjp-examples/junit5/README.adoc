== JUnit5

As of this writing (December, 2015), JUnit 5 is still very much a draft
(which is why we must fetch it from the Snapshot Repository!).
These few simple examples illustrate a small part of the improvements
in JUnit 5, but it is all subject to change.
Accordingly, if you bump the version number of the JUnit library,
expect breakage!
