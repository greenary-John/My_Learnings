Local Development Workflow with docker
 - Local Docker Container for development so that other developers in the team need not install anything 
   other than docker to start with running the application.

- Docker Tools is old and you should use either docker for mac or docker for Windows

  (What do you mean sharing all files on machines as a volume within a docker container in real time?.
   This helps with changes in files to be reflected on docker filesystem and all external dependencies
   will be maintained within the docker container)
